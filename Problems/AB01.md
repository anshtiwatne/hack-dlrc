# Binary Number Conversion

## Description

Sachin Sir is teaching students how binary numbers work. He wants the students to cross check their answers with a calculator but is worried using one on the internet will distract the students.  
He asks you to make a simple program that will accept a binary number string like `0001 0111` and convert it to the corresponding denary number, in this case `23`.

## Testing

### Data

1. `0000 0000` should result in `0`
2. `1` should result in `1`
3. `1 1 1 1` should result in `15`

### Undefined Behaviour (UB)

1. `ABCD` leads to UB
2. `123` leads to UB
3. `-1001` leads to UB

## Additional Information

1. A valid binary string is one that contains the characters `0`, `1` or ` ` (whitespace). Your algorithm may be tested against invalid strings.
2. Spaces are to be ignored, meaning `1001` is equivalent to `1 0 0 1`
