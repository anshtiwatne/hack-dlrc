# About

HackDLRC is a hackathon hosted by Ansh Tiwatne and Aneesh Bhave. It is open for all, participate individually by signing in on this website or as a team through this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/2Uk74hRZF57HxhZSA).

# Solving Problems

HackDLRC consists of 7 problems that get progressively harder. A beginner level sample problem has been posted [here](REDIRECT_TO_SAMPLE_PROBLEM). Please do not use AI to get on the leader board.

## Interpreting Information

Each problem comes with the name of the problem, the points associated with it, the description of the problem, a worked example, some additional information and resources that would help you solve the problem.

### Name

Each problem is based on a subject taught at [DLRC](dlrc.in). The sample problem is a Math class for middle school

### Points

Each problem is worth a certain number of points. The [sample problem](REDIRECT_TO_SAMPLE_PROBLEM) is worth 0 points. The [leader board](REDIRECT_TO_LEADERBOARD) shows each participant ranked based on the points they have acquired. They are also ranked based on time of completion, so make sure you solve the problems as soon as you can!

### Description

Each problem has a brief description that introduces the premise of the problem and provides details about the problem.

### Worked Example

The worked example is provided so participants can gain clarity on the assigned problem. Note that the actual input provided to you will be much much larger. Your input can be accessed by clicking on the "Get Input" button on the page of the problem. Please make sure your program does not depend on the number of lines in the input.

### Additional Information

This section contains information that can help programmers design their solution. Information like the most optimal data type to be used, assumptions that the program can make etc.

### Resources

Additional resources may be provided that would allow the participant to gain clarity on keywords used in the problem statement. This ensures people without a computer science background but with programming knowledge can understand the problems just as well as people with those backgrounds.

## Supported Programming Language

The inbuilt text editor on the website allows a participant to use JavaScript, Python, Java, C/C++, C# and Go. Note that participants may choose to use their own language to solve the problem and obtain an answer. We recommend using a high level programming language that you are most comfortable with. However, creativity is encouraged, we would love to feature solutions written in esoteric programming languages and ones that use non conventional algorithms.
