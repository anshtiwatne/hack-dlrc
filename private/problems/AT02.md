## Description
Aishwariya ma'am is teaching her students about the nucleotide sequences in DNA. These sequences consist of two strands: the primary strand and the complementary strand. Each strand is composed of four distinct nucleotides represented by letters â€“ A (adenine), C (cytosine), G (guanine), and T (thymine). The pairing of nucleotides of the main and complementary strand follows a specific rule: A pairs with T, and G pairs with C. Aishwariya ma'am needs your help determining any wrongly paired nucleotides along with their location in the sequence.

## Example

ATGA

TACG

The first and second strands are separated by newlines. The first pair is AT, the second TA, third GC and fourth AG. Since the fourth pair is not valid, the output is AG-4.

## Additional info
1. The input only consists of the A, T, C, G and the newline character.
2. There is only one invalid pair of nucleotides in the sequence.
3. The pairs are numbered beginning from 1.
