## Description
Sachin Sir is teaching students how numbers can be represented in alternate number systems. He assigns them a problem that involves finding the sum of the given numbers in denary. The given numbers are in varying number systems, some are in binary (base-2), others in unary (base-1), some in hexadecimal (base-16) and some in plain old denary (base-10). You see a pattern in this assignment and are asked to write an algorithm for it. There are several lines of input, each containing a base number, a sign and the number to be converted.

## Example
1. Single Line  
```
+ 16 F
```
Above line is to be interpreted as the number `+15`  

2. Multi Line
```
+ 1 1111
- 2 100
+ 10 115
- 16 F
- 1 11111
- 5 10
```
The above input evalues to `(+4) + (-4) + (+115) + (-15) + (-5) + (-5)` which equals `90`.

## Additional Information
- You can assume each number is is in the correct base. For example, lines like `+ 2 123` will never exist.
- Each line has the sign, the base and then the number separated by a space
- The base is a number between 1 and 16, inclusive on both ends, i.e. `[1,16]`
- The sum of these numbers can be stored in an unsigned 64 bit integer
