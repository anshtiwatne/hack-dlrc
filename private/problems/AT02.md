## Description
Aishwariya ma'am is teaching her students about DNA sequences. In a sequence there are two strands with 4 types of nucleotides A - adenine, C - cytosine, G - guanine, T - thymine. These bases can only pair in the following manner: A pairs with T and G pairs with C. She needs your help checking if a student has made the correct pairing in the DNA sequence.

## Example

ATGA

TACG

The first and second strands are separated by newlines. The first pair is AT, the second TA, third GC and fourth AG. Since the fourth pair is incorrect, your output is AG

## Additional info
1. The input only consists of the A, T, C, G and the newline character.
2. There is only one error in the sequence
