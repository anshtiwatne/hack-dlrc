# Balancing Chemical Equations

## Description

Sona ma'am is running an experiment involving a bunch of chemical reactions. She refers to a large list of balanced chemical equations her interns made for her. While conducting the experiment however, something blows up. Sona ma'am knows that her interns messed up and one of the equations is incorrectly balanced, but since this is a massive list, she asks for your help in finding this equation.

## Testing

### Positive Data
1. `H20 + O2 -> H2O2` should result in `2H2O + O2 -> 2H2O2`
2. `CO2 + H20 -> C6H12O6 + O2` should result in `6CO2 + 6H20 -> C6H12O6 + 6O2`
3. `CH4 + O2 -> CO2 + H2O` should result in `CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O`

### Negative Data
1. `H2O + O2 -> CO2` should result in an error
2. `C4H8 -> CO2 + H20` should result in an error
3. `H2SO4 + KOH -> K2SO4` should result in an error

## Additional Information
1. A balanced equation means you must have the same number of atoms of each element on both sides of the equation.
2. In `3H20`, the integer 2 following the element `H` means I have 2 atoms of `H`, however the integer 3 before the element `H` but following no element means I have 3 molecules of `H20`. Using this information I can deduce that I have 6 atoms of `H` and 3 of `O`.
3. Two different molecules are separated by ` + `, you can only add or coefficients to the molecules, not the individual elements.
4. The reactants and the products (left and right side of the equation) are separated by ` -> `.
5. For simplification, all elements will be a single capital letter symbol.
