## Points

## Description

Ankit Sir, Sweety Ma'am, Priyanka Ma'am and Mona Ma'am all notice that their English students are overusing alliteration in their essays. They assign an essay question to their students and accept responses via email. They ask you to write an algorithm that will detect groups of three words that use alliteration. This algorithm must ignore all articles. Your program must count the number of alliterated groups in an essay.

## Examples

1.

```
Heralding a harmonious hackathon, tech enthusiasts tirelessly tackle tantalizing tasks to triumph in this thrilling technology challenge.
```

Alliterated groups - `Heralding a harmonious hackathon` ('a' ignored), `tirelessly tackle tantalizing`, `tackle tantalizing tasks` and `this thrilling technology`. Hence the number of groups present is `4`.

2.

```
Amidst the avid atmosphere of the annual hackathon, creative coders collaboratively craft cutting-edge solutions to conquer complex computing conundrums.
```

Alliterated groups - `Amidst the avid atmosphere` ('the' ignored), `creative coders collaboratively`, `coders collaboratively craft`, `collaboratively craft cutting-edge`, `conquer complex computing` and `complex computing conundrums`. Hence the number of groups present is `6`

## Additional Information

1. Your program must be case insensitive, meaning "Hello" is the same word as "hello"
2. Words are separated by a whitespace character
3. `a`, `an` and `the` are articles to be ignored
4. Words are considered to be alliterated if they all start with the same letter
5. A group of 4 alliterated words contains 2 groups of 3. The first 3 words and the last 3 words. The same logic is to be applied for groups with more words
6. Your actual input will not contain sentences that make sense.
