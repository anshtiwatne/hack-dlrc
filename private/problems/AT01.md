# Chemical Catastrophe

## Description

Sona ma'am is running an experiment involving a bunch of chemical reactions. She refers to an extensive list of chemical equations prepared by her interns. While conducting the experiment however doesn't go as planned. Sona ma'am deduces one of the equations has mismatched elements in the reactant and products, but since this is a very large list, she asks for your help in finding this equation.

### Example
1. `H2O + O2 -> H2O2`
2. `CO2 + H20 -> C6H12O6 + O2`
3. `H2SO4 + KOH -> K2SO4`

The first equation has the reactant elements [H, O] and the product elements [H, O], therefore it is correct.

The second equation has the reactant elements [C, 0, H] and the product elements [C, H, O], therefore it is correct.

The third equation has the reactant elements [H, S, O, K] and the product elements [K, S, O], therefore it is incorrect as we have an H (hydrogen) missing in the elements the product is made of.

## Additional Information
1. You can disregard any balancing in the equation
2. The `+` symbol separates molecules while the `->` symbol separates reactants from products
4. For simplification, all elements will be a single capital letter symbol.
5. These equations in your input might not exist in the real world but assume they do.
