# Taxicab Argument

## Description
Aman sir is teaching his students about taxicab geometry and he comes up with a problem that would keep his students engaged. You being a programmer, decide to solve the question by writing an algorithm. The problem has several single character lines, which can either be 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' and 'R'. You are to start at coordinates (0,0) and move based on the input. Your program is to take this input and then output the final (integer) distance from the center.

Input Key -  
N - Move one step north, Ex - (0,0) -> (0,1)  
S - Move one step south, Ex - (0,0) -> (0,-1)  
E - Move one step east, Ex - (0,0) -> (1,0)  
W - Move one step west, Ex - (0,0) -> (-1,0)  
R - Reset position, Ex - (4,-5) -> (0,0)

## Testing

### Data
1.
```
N
E
W
S
R
N
E
```
Results in the character's position being (1,1), the distance from center is sqrt(2). The integer distance is int(1.414...) = 1.

2.
```
N
N
N
N
N
R
N
N
N
N
N
R
```
Results in the character's position being (0,0), the distance from center is 0.

3.
```
E
W
E
E
W
W
N
N
W
```
Results in the character's position being (-1, 2), the distance from center is sqrt(5), the integer distance is int(2.236...) = 2.

### Undefined Behaviour (UB)
- Any line that does not contain 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' or 'R' is UB

## Additional Information
- The distance between two points refers to the euclidian distance between them
- An integer casting function *must* be used to convert a floating point value to an integer. If your programming language does not have an integer casting function, use the `floor` function instead.
