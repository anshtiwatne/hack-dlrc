# About

HackDLRC is a hackathon hosted by Ansh Tiwatne and Aneesh Bhave.

It is open for all. You can participate individually by signing in on this website or as a team through this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/2Uk74hRZF57HxhZSA).

# Solving Problems

HackDLRC consists of 7 problems that get progressively harder.

A beginner level sample problem has been posted [here](REDIRECT_TO_SAMPLE_PROBLEM). Solutions to the Sample Problem can be found [here](https://github.com/nouritsu/dlrc-hackathon-sample-solutions).

The input for a problem is accessed by clicking on the "Get Input" button on the page of the problem. Make sure your program does not depend on the number of lines in the input.

Do not use AI to get on the leader board.

## Interpreting Information

Each problem comes with the name of the problem, the points associated with it, the description of the problem, a worked example, as well as additional information and resources that may help you solve the problem.

### Name

Each problem is based on a subject taught at [DLRC](dlrc.in). The sample problem is a Math class for middle school.

### Points

Solving each problem will award you a certain number of points. The [sample problem](REDIRECT_TO_SAMPLE_PROBLEM) is worth 0 points.

The [leader board](REDIRECT_TO_LEADERBOARD) ranks each participant by their points. Rankings are also based on time of completion, so make sure you solve the problems as quickly as you can!

### Description

The description of each problem introduces the premise and provides the necessary details.

### Worked Example

Participants can use the worked example to gain clarity on the structure of the question, inputs and expected answers.

Note that the actual input for a problem will be much larger.

### Additional Information

This section contains information that can help programmers design their solution, like the most optimal data type to be used, assumptions that the program can make, etc.

### Resources

Additional resources may be provided that allow the participant to gain clarity on keywords used in the problem. This ensures people without a computer science background but with programming knowledge can understand the problems.

## Supported Programming Languages

The inbuilt text editor on the website allows a participant to use JavaScript, Python, Java, C/C++, C# and Go.

Note that participants may choose to use their own language to solve the problem and obtain an answer. We recommend using a high level programming language that you are most comfortable with.

However, creativity is encouraged, and we would love to feature solutions written in esoteric programming languages and ones that use non-conventional algorithms.
