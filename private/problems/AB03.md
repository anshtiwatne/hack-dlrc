## Description
Aman sir is teaching his students about taxicab geometry and he comes up with a problem that would keep his students engaged. You being a programmer, decide to solve the question by writing an algorithm. The problem has several single character lines, which can either be `N`, `S`, `E`, `W` and `R`. You are to start at coordinates `(0, 0)` and move based on the input. Your program must take this input and then output the final (integer) distance from the center.\n
\n
Input Key -\n
`N` - Move one step north, Ex - `(0, 0)` -> `(0, 1)`\n
`S` - Move one step south, Ex - `(0, 0)` -> `(0, -1)`\n
`E` - Move one step east, Ex - `(0, 0)` -> `(1, 0)`\n
`W` - Move one step west, Ex - `(0, 0)` -> `(-1, 0)`\n
`R` - Reset position, Ex - `(4, -5)` -> `(0, 0)`\n

## Example

1.

`N`\n
`E`\n
`R`\n
`S`\n
`W`\n
\n
The character started at `(0, 0)`, moved N and E, then reset again to `(0, 0)`, moved S and E; and finally stopped at `(-1, 1)`, therefore the distance traveled is `sqrt((-1)² + 1²) = 1.414...`, which is rounded to the nearest integer `1`.\n

## Additional Information

-   The distance between two points refers to the euclidean distance between them
-   Each line only contains the direction and the newline character(s)
-   An integer casting function _must_ be used to convert a floating point value to an integer. If your programming language does not have an integer casting function, use the `floor` function instead.
