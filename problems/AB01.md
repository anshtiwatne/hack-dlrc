## Description

Sachin Sir is teaching students how numbers can be represented in alternate number systems. He assigns them a problem that involves finding the sum of the given numbers in denary. The numbers are given in number systems ranging from base-1 all the way up to base-16. There are several lines of input, each containing the sign, a base number, and the number to be converted.

## Example

1. Single Line

```
+ 16 F
```

Above line is to be interpreted as the number `+15`

2. Multi Line

```
+ 1 1111
- 2 100
+ 10 115
- 16 F
- 1 11111
- 5 10
```

The above input evaluates to `(+4) + (-4) + (+115) + (-15) + (-5) + (-5)` which equals `90`.

## Additional Information

-   You can assume each number is is in the correct base. For example, lines like `+ 2 123` will never exist.
-   Each line has the sign, the base and then the number separated by a space
-   The base is a number between 1 and 16, inclusive on both ends, i.e. `[1,16]`
-   The sum of these numbers can be stored in an unsigned 64 bit integer
