# Assembly Interpreter

## Description
Mona Ma'am and Priyanka Ma'am are accepting responses to an essay question via email. They want to see which of their students have a limited vocabulary.  
They ask you to write a program to find if a response has a word longer than 6 characters appearing more than 6 times.

## Testing

### Data
1. "Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello" should return `false` (since words are 6 characters long, not more than 6)
2. "I love DLRCHackathon I love DLRCHackathon I love DLRCHackathon I love DLRCHackathon I love DLRCHackathon I love DLRCHackathon I love DLRCHackathon" should return `true` (since DLRCHackathon appears more than 6 times)
3. "A normal sentence like this one should just return false" should return `false` (since no word that is more than 6 letters long appears more than 6 times)

### Undefined Behaviour (UB)
N.A.

## Additional Information
1. Your program must be case insensitive, meaning "Hello" is the same word as "hello"
2. Your program should print "true" if the response matches the criterion and "false" if it does not
3. Words are seperated by a whitespace character
