# Hash

## Description
Aneesh and Ansh are designing a hackathon. In the hackathon, they will provide the players with some input data. They decide that this input however must be randomized for every user to avoid cheating. Aneesh has designed a set of 10 inputs, and Ansh writes some code to hash a user's ID into an integer between 1 and 10 that corresponds to their input. They want to make sure that no more than 5 people receive the same set of inputs and give you a list of usernames with their assigned input set number.
