# Kepler thing

# Description
Aman sir has been observing a few star systems with his new telescope recently. He has collected data about the orbital velocities and the distances of the planets from their star. Out of the star systems he observed, he needs your help finding out which star system has planets with the heaviest average mass.

To do this he teaches you a couple of equations. Firstly the mass M of a planet is found by the equation `M = 4pi²r³/GT²`, where `pi` is a constant you can assume to be `3.14`, `r` is the radius or distance of the planet from the star, `G` is the gravitational constant which you can assume to be `6.67x10⁻¹¹` and lastly T is the time period (the time it takes for the planet to orbit the star). Now to calculate the Time period `T` you have a separate equation `T = 2pir/V`, where `V` is the orbital velocity of the planet.

Using these equations for each planet in each star system, you need to find the average mass of a planet in the system and find the system with the highest average planet mass. Each newline is a planet with orbital velocity V and distance from the star R, and each star system is separated by newlines.

# Example
V12-R5
V5-R6
V4-R12

V11-R15
V12-R54

Here we have two star systems, one with 3 planets and another with 2. using the equations we get the masses of the planets in the first system to be [x, y, z], therefore the average is A and the masses of planets B to be [a, b, c], therefore the average is B.
