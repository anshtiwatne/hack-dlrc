# Balancing Chemical Equations

## Description

Sona ma'am has a lot of chemical equations she needs to balance in order to set up a practical for her students. She consults you for help. She has given you 10 chemical equations and you need to balance them for her.

## Testing

### Positive Data
1. `H20 + O2 -> H2O2` should result in `2H2O + O2 -> 2H2O2`
2. `CO2 + H20 -> C6H12O6 + O2` should result in `6CO2 + 6H20 -> C6H12O6 + 6O2`
3. `CH4 + O2 -> CO2 + H2O` should result in `CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O`

### Negative Data
1. `H2O + O2 -> CO2` should result in an error
2. `C4H8 -> CO2 + H20` should result in an error
3. `H2SO4 + KOH -> K2SO4` should result in an error

## Additional Information
1. A balanced equation means you must have the same number of atoms of each element on both sides of the equation.
2. In `3H20`, the integer 2 following the element `H` means I have 2 atoms of `H`, however the integer 3 before the element `H` but following no element means I have 3 molecules of `H20`. Using this information I can deduce that I have 6 atoms of `H` and 3 of `O`.
3. Two different molecules are separated by ` + `, you can only add or coefficients to the molecules, not the individual elements.
4. The reactants and the products (left and right side of the equation) are separated by ` -> `.
5. For simplification, all elements will be a single capital letter symbol.
